**A super simple wallet application for the NANO cryptocurrency that runs in the terminal**

I originally made this just for fun, with no intention of sharing the code, but someone on the [Nano Discord server](https://chat.nano.org/) suggested I post it on Github, so here it is. Enjoy, I guess.

You can now send and receive Nano in the terminal. Here's a short list of this wallet's features:

- Automatically broadcasts receive blocks when Nano is sent to your address
- Uses a 3rd-party server to communicate with the Nano network. A list can be found in `api_servers.txt`
- Solves the proof-of-work client-side only if it can't be solved by the server for some reason
- Pretty decent UI given that it literally just runs in the terminal (or "command prompt" if you're uncool)
- Uses \*´¯\`\*.¸¸.\*´¯\`\*   🎀  𝓂𝓊𝓁𝓉𝒾𝓅𝓇♡𝒸𝑒𝓈𝓈𝒾𝓃𝑔  🎀   \*\`¯´\*.¸¸.\*\`¯´\*

Why use Nault or Natrium when you got the ¸„.-•\~¹°”ˆ˜¨ Nαɳσ Tҽɾɱιɳαʅ Wαʅʅҽƚ ¨˜ˆ”°¹\~•-.„¸?
